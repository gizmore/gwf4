GWF Coding Conditions

General:
We want to have clean Code.
GWF wants to be fast and secure!
Small Code is cool Code.
small code !== foo(bar(baz(asdf(qwertz(blah(blub()))))));
Code should be readable!

Constants:
Name has to be UPPERCASE
Name has to start with GWF_

Classes:
have to start with GWF_
first letter after GWF_ must be capitalized
have to get an own file
filename have to be the GWF_Classname.php
right: require_once 'GWF_Classname.php';
wrong: include("GWF_Classname.php");
use __construct() not Classname as constructor

Functions:
do not shorten functionname!
functionnames must _NOT_ contain underscore (_)
right: function thisIsAFunction()
wrong: function this_is_a_func()

Methods:
see Functions
always write the access modifiers (public, protected, private)
(public|protected|private) static? methodname()

Static variables:
Should be written UPPERCASE.
Example is public static $FOO = 'baz';

Comments:
are very welcome
use # for short comments (e.g. for the step)
use // for commenting out codelines
use /** for descriptions of functions/methods
/* */ is not very well seen for commenting out code
####################
## use for blocks ##

Code indentation:
with tabs
lineendings === \n !=== \r\n?

Style:
Strings without containing variables has to be in 'singlequotes'
Strings containing variables: "foo{$bar}baz"
right:
function()
{
wrong: function() {\n
right: foo( bar() ) || foo($bar)
wrong: foo(bar())
right: if(foo())

Comparision:
first the constant, then the $variable
right: if(NULL === $foo)
wrong: if($foo === NULL)
always compare typesafe!
wrong if('bar' == $foo); if($bar)
right: if('bar' === $foo); if(true === $bar)


Return:
use $back for strings
use $ret for bool/int
