=== GWFv3 installation guide ===
================================

GWFv3 is split into two locations: The core and the www part.

To run GWFv3 on a computer, please copy everything but www/ to a folder of your choice.
Then copy the www/ folder to a directory served by an httpd.
It is possible to serve multiple site installation with the same core.
It is also possible to have everything in the same directory, simply copy the www folder one dir up. This _should_ not add any security issue.

After you have copied your files, please execute /install/wizard.php with your browser and follow the instructions.

Enjoy!
