Q) Is it secure?

A) Nothing can be guaranteed to be secure.
   GWFv3 has been developed with the focus on security, and has been in production for quite some time now.
   If you want to pentest it you may want to disable csrf tokens.

----------------------------------------

Q) How fast is it?

A) It compares good to other software, but don't expect wonders as it is serving highly dynamic content.
   The memory usage is ok, for example i got very simple pages with 750kb memory peak, so it should scale well.
   Sadly, this is currently not true for every page, especially the forum is still very slow.
