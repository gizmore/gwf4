<h1>About Slaytags</h1>

<p>Slaytags is a temporary project to allow users of <a href="http://slayradio.org">slayradio</a> and <a href="http://remix.kwed.org">remix.kwed</a> to tag the songs.</p>
<p>As soon as Slaygon releases a new version of the slayradio website, this site might disappear, as a similar functionality will be availbe at slayradio.</p>
<p>The collected data will be made accessible to the public, and hopefully be of use for Slaygon or maybe even remix.kwed.</p>
